            A kitten is a <strong>juvenile</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank">cat</a>.
            After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are totally dependent
            on their mother for survival. <em> They do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten days.</em>
            After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a
            further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly
            social animals and usually enjoy human companionship.
